# Excel import into EDC

this folder is used to store files referenced by the youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztiJZEKNufI

the original link posted is no longer valid (was a public s3 bucket) - the individual files references & the .zip are now located here.

# Implementation Note:

- the example was created in 2019 & is still valid with current versions
- there are some newer api's available that may be better/faster
  - a patch method for objects
  - bulk import using csv
